Temperature-Dependent Steel Plastic Material Properties Generator
Introduction
This Python script generates temperature-dependent steel plastic material properties for finite element analysis, particularly for Abaqus software packages. The material properties generated are essential for accurately simulating steel behavior under various thermal conditions.

Input Data
T (Temperature): A list of temperatures in degrees Celsius.
f (Residual Yield Factor): A list of factors representing the residual yield strength at each temperature.
E (Young's Modulus): Young's modulus of the steel material in GPa.
Fy (Yield Strength): Yield strength of the steel material in MPa.
Fu (Ultimate Strength): Ultimate strength of the steel material in MPa.
ey (Yield Strain): Calculated yield strain based on the yield strength and Young's modulus.
eu (Ultimate Strain): Ultimate strain of the steel material.
ef (Final Strain): Final strain for calculation purposes.
Code Description
The code performs the following steps:

Define Combined Equation: A function to calculate plastic stress based on given engineering strain and residual yield factor.
Initialize Lists: Empty lists to store plastic stress and strain data.
Engineering Strain: Generate engineering strain data.
Calculate Plastic Stress and Strain: For each temperature and strain rate pair, calculate plastic stress and strain.
Flatten the Lists: Combine plastic stress and strain data into single arrays.
Create DataFrame: Store plastic stress, plastic strain, and temperature data in a Pandas DataFrame.
Export to Excel: Save the DataFrame to an Excel file.
